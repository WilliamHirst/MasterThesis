	abstract = {A search for the pair production of heavy leptons as predicted by the type-{III} seesaw mechanism is presented. The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 {TeV}, corresponding to 139 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of integrated luminosity recorded by the {ATLAS} detector during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis focuses on the final state with two light leptons (electrons or muons) of different flavour and charge combinations, with at least two jets and large missing transverse momentum. No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed. The results are translated into exclusion limits on heavy-lepton masses, and the observed lower limit on the mass of the type-{III} seesaw heavy leptons is 790 {GeV} at 95\% confidence level.},

	abstract = {Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on `shallow' machine learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex non-linear functions of the inputs, and rely on a pain-staking search through manually constructed non-linear features. Progress on this problem has slowed, as a variety of techniques have shown equivalent performance. Recent advances in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions and better discriminate between signal and background classes. Using benchmark datasets, we show that deep learning methods need no manually constructed inputs and yet improve the classification metric by as much as 8{\textbackslash}\% over the best current approaches. This demonstrates that deep learning approaches can improve the power of collider searches for exotic particles.},
