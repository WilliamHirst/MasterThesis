\section{Proton-Proton collisions at the LHC}
\subsection{An Introduction to Particle Accelerators and Detecors}\label{subsec:Detector}
With a circumference of 27 km, the \emph{particle accelerator} \ac{LHC} is the largest piece of scientific 
equipment ever built. It consists of two separate large tubes aligned with powerful magnets. The magnets are used 
to accelerate bunches\footnote{Pockets of around $10^{11}$ protons.} of hadrons (specifically protons) and lead. One set 
of bunches are accelerated in one of the tubes, and another set is accelerated in the other direction inside the 
other tube. The bunches are accelerated up to close (v=0.99999991c) the speed of light before they collide at a 
rate of once every 25 nanosecond. The released energy from the collisions enable the creations of new particles.
\\
To measure the collisions, we use \emph{particle detectors}. In this thesis I will be using data collected by the 
\acs{ATLAS} (\acl{ATLAS}) detector. The \ac{ATLAS}-detector is the largest general-purpose detector at the \ac{LHC}
and was first active in 2009. The detector consists of several ever-increasing cylindrical layers around the point of 
collision. In figure \ref{fig:detector}, taken from the \ac{ATLAS} collaboration \cite{PDetector} the cross section 
of the detector along with the paths of different particles is visualized. The inside of a detector can be summarized 
in the following points, listed from innermost to outermost layer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Inner Detector}: The inner detector consists of three layers, Pixel detector, Semi-Conductor Tracker 
          and Transition Radiation Tracker. Its purpose is to measure electromagnetic interactions between the particles 
          produced in the collision and the material in the layers. The measurements are made at discrete points and can be 
          used to infer the momentum of the particles. An electromagnetic field is applied to the inner detector
          to curve the paths of the particles, so to measure properties of the particles like spin and charge.  
    \item \emph{Calorimeters}: The \ac{ATLAS} detector has two calorimeters, the \emph{Electromagnetic calorimeter} and the 
           \emph{Hadronic calorimeter}. The \ac{EM} calorimeter is the first layer of the two and measures the energy of 
           particles interacting through the \ac{EM} field. The hadronic calorimeter is designed to measure the energy of 
           hadrons (i.e. protons, neutrons, mesons etc.).
    \item \emph{Muon Spectrometer}: The muon spectrometer is included to detect muons, which would otherwise not be measured 
           by the previous layers. Similarly to the inner detector, the muon spectrometer applies a \ac{EM} field to 
           curve the path of the particles which allows it to measure several properties. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Kinematics}
The kinematic variables of a particle collision are crucial in any \ac{HEP} analysis and are easily explained using simple 
geometry. In figure \ref{fig:Kinematics} I have drawn a simple axis to illustrate the kinematics of a particle in both the 
longitudinal (left) and transverse (right) plane. In a three-dimensional axis where the particles colliding travel along the 
z-axis, the zy-axis defines the longitudinal plane.  The angle between the z-axis and the direction of the momentum of
one of the particles, define the polar angle of said particle, $\theta$. The xy-axis define the transverse plane and the 
angle between the x-axis and the direction of the transverse momentum define the azimuthal angle, $\phi$.
\begin{figure}

    figure in the paper by Gramstad \cite{gramstad_searches_nodate}. The illustration shows both the 
    longitudial and transverse plane. }
    \label{fig:Kinematics}
\end{figure}
The transverse momentum and the azimuthal angel are both used in this analysis and are used to create further features. 
Instead of the polar angle, a preferred feature is the pseudorapidity, $\eta$. The pseudorapidity is defined as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:eta}
    \eta = -ln\left[tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right]
\end{align}
The pseudorapidity is a preferred feature to the polar angle because differences in $\eta$ are lorentz invariant under boosts 
along the longitudial axis. A large range of features are created using the variables described above. In the appendix I have 
added a summary of all the features used in this analysis (see table \ref{table:Features}). One of said features is the distance 
between the particle in the $\eta-\phi$-axis, $\Delta R$. We define $\Delta R$ as 
\begin{align}
    \Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2}.
\end{align}
