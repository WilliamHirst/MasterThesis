\chapter{The Standard model of elementary particles and beyond.}

The \ac{SM} is the most successful scientific theory ever
created. It accurately explains the interactions of leptons and quarks as well as the force
carrying particles which mediate said interactions. The model is a result of over a century of work
demanding the contributions of great minds like Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrodinger and Richard Feynman.
In 2012 the SM achieved one of its crowning achievements when we discovered the Higgs boson \cite{Aad_2012}. 
In spite of the success of the \ac{SM}, there are still questions we are unable to answer.
\ac{SM} is yet to merge the physics of the micro and macro or even accommedate the particles that make
up most of the universe. Most people believe this is not a sign to discard the \ac{SM}, but instead to expand it!
