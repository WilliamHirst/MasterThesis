\chapter{The Standard Model of Elementary Particles and Beyond}
Although this paper will primarily emphasize the \ac{ML} aspect of a particle physics analysis, there are still terms and phenomena that are worth defining.
In this chapter, I will introduce the basics in particle physics, ranging from explaining the leptons and quarks to defining the layers inside a 
particle detector. Furthermore, I will introduce the relevant extension of the \ac{SM}, i.e. \ac{SUSY}, and present some Feynman diagrams 
to give further insight into the data set.
