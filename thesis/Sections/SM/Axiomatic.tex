\chapter{The Standard model of elementary particles}

The \ac{SM} is the most successful scientific theory ever
created. It accurately explains the interactions of leptons and quarks as well as the force
carrying particles which mediate said interactions. The model is a result of over a century of work
demanding the contributions of grat minds like Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrodinger and Richard Feynman.
In 2012 the SM achieved one of its crowning achievements when we discovered the Higgs boson.
