\section{Beyond the Standard Model}

        All that remains is more and more precise measurement.'

The quote above is rumored to have been spoken by William Thompson(\emph{1824–1907}), better
known as Lord Kelvin when addressing the British Association for the Advancement
of Science in 1900. The statement followed a long period of advancements in the
field of physics by the likes of James Clerk Maxwell (\emph{1831–1879}) and 
Michael Faraday (\emph{1791–1867}). It would take less than half a decade
before he would understand the magnitude of his miscalculation, when Einstein and 
Planck began the development of Quantum Mechanics. Just as Kelvin was wrong back then, 
would he be wrong today. For although \ac{SM} explains a large range of phenomena,
there are yet many mysteries to explain in the universe and even problems rooted in \ac{SM}.
In this section I will explain some of the problems we hope to tackle in the future. 
\\ \newline
As mentioned in previous section, \ac{SM} is yet to explain \emph{gravity}. The hope has been
to integrate gravity into \ac{SM} through the discovery of a gravity-carrying particle, 
the gravtion. So far, no-such particle is found. \emph{Dark matter} and \emph{dark energy} are 
also not described by \ac{SM}, even though the two makeup more than $90\%$ of the mass in the 
observable universe. Inflation is today the leading explanation to what happened in the early-stages
(the first fraction of a second) of the universe. It explains a universe in which all space
undergoes a rapid increase in rate of expansion. None of the fields explained by \ac{SM} are 
capable of causing any such expansion. Finally, and the one most relevant for this analysis is the
neutrino-mass and \ac{CP}-violation problems, but this will be discussed in the next section.
\subsection{Neutrino-Mass problem}
Neutrinos have a special place in physics. For one, they are the only particles that
only interact by the weak force. This means that neutrinos rarely interact at all. It is often used
as a (granted for many not incredibly exiting) conversation piece that a colossal amount ($ca.10^{14}$) of 
neutrinos pass through your body every second. This is harmless to us exactly because of the rarity
of neutrinos interaction with anything. For this reason we call neutrinos ghostly. 
\\
Another reason neutrinos are special is that they exhibit flavor mixing. In 2015 Arthur McDonald (\emph{1943-}) and 
Takaaki Kajita (\emph{1959-}) were awarded the Nobel Prize for their contributions in the discovery. In simple terms,
flavor mixing is a process where a particle oscillates between different flavors. For neutrinos this 
means oscillating between $\nu_e,\ \nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$. Flavor mixing is in it of itself not special.
Quarks have been observed to exhibit the same behavior. The reason this is interesting in the case of 
neutrinos, is that it implies that neutrinos are massive. Before this discovery, we believed neutrinos to be
massless. But why are massive neutrinos a problem?
\\
All (previously) known massive particles gain mass through interactions with the Higgs boson. For particles
to gain mass they need to have a right- and left-handed\footnote{The handedness of a particle is defined
as a relation between the direction of spin and momentum for a particle. Right means the two are directed
in the same direction and left corresponds to opposite direction.} particle. So far, no right-handed neutrinos
have been observed. Generally there are two schools of thought for why a right-handed neutrino has not been 
observed. Either, it is very heavy, and we are yet to generate energies large enough to recreate it, or 
it is indistinguishable to the left-handed neutrino. In the first scenario we would call the right-handed 
neutrino a \emph{Dirac} fermion. This means that it is no different from any other right-handed lepton. In the second
the right-handed neutrino is a \emph{Majorana} fermion. A Majorana fermion is simply a lepton where the particle
and the antiparticle are the same. In this thesis I have searched for a right-handed neutrino and considered
both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos.
