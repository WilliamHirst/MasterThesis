The standard model (SM) is perhaps one of the most successful scientific theories ever created. It accurately explains the interactions of leptons and quarks as well as the force carrying particles which mediate said interactions. In 2012 the SM achieved one of its crowning achievements when we discovered the Higgs boson. Much of the accolade was rightfully given to the theoretical work on the SM, but another aspect of the discovery was equally important. Data analysis was and is a crucial part of any new discovery in physics. One of the most important and exiting tools is machine learning.
