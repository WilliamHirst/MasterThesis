\chapter{Results \& Discussion from the Analysis}\label{subsec:ResDisc}
In this, the final chapter of my thesis I will present the results from my analysis. First,
I will present the result from my study of each model individually, followed by sections 
comparing the performance from all models on a subset of the data. Finally, I will compare 
the models on their performance on the full statistics and compare them to a similar \ac{ATLAS} 
analysis in 2021 \cite{atlas_search_2021}.
