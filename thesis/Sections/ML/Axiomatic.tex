\chapter{Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Analysis}\label{chap:Intro ML}
Machine learning is rapidly becoming an overwhelming presens in many scientific fields.
In areas ranging from cancer research to stock-trading, machine learning is being applied to problems
once thought as impossible to solve. Particle physics, like many other fields is no exception. Jet flavor classification \cite{Guest_2016}, 
separating jets from gluons \cite{PhysRevD.44.2025} or using \ac{ML} to create efficient \ac{SR} are just some examples
where \ac{ML} is a vital tool. The traditional approach for ML in high-energy physics is through the use 
of supervised learning. \ac{DNN}
