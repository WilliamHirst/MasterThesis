\chapter{Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Analysis}\label{chap:Intro ML}
Within this chapter, I will introduce the basics of data analysis and \ac{ML}, as well as describe the 
algorithms underlying the set of models I tested during my analysis. Additionally, I will in the final part of the chapter 
describe where \ac{ML} fits into a particle physics analysis and how I intend to assess the performs of the analysis.
