\section{Selection Feature for the Analysis}\label{sec:Feats}
The choice of which features to study and which to neglect is crucial in a search for new physics. This is particularly true 
in the case of applying machine learning. The general motivation for including a given feature can be based on several factors. 
One reason being its ability to provide a trend which we as researchers can exploit when creating ours signal regions. By this I mean
that it is a variable were there is a diversity in distribution between the different channels. This is often physics motivated, for example 
including a feature on the transverse missing energy on the basis that we are searching for a signal with large amounts of it. 
Another reason is grounded in the \ac{MC}-simmulations ability to represent the variable. If there seems to be a clear deviation between the 
measured and simulated data which does not stem from any new physics, the feature could be adding noise to the data set. In the following sections 
I will discuss the various features included in the data sets (both simulated and measured), which are also summarized in the appendix in table \ref{table:Features}.
