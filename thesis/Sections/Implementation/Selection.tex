\subsection{Lepton Variables}\label{subsec:LepSel}
Information regarding the kinematics of the electrons and muons were added into the data set: i.e. the transverse momentum, $p_T$, the pseudo 
rapidity, $\eta$, and the azimuth angle, $\phi$. All kinematic features were represented individually for each lepton. For example $p_T$
was added as three columns: $p_T(l_1)$, $p_T(l_2)$ and $p_T(l_3)$, where the ordering of the leptons were based on the momentum from highest ($l_1$) 
to lowest ($l_3$). Similarly, I added information regarding the charge ($\pm$) and flavor (electron, muon) of each lepton. Based on the kinematic variables
the transverse mass, $M_T$, of each lepton was calculated, $\Delta R$ for the two leading leptons, and the transverse component, $E_T^{miss}$, and azimuth angle,
$\phi^{miss}$, of the missing momentum.
\\
Furthermore, I added different mass variables, namely $m_{lll}$ and $m_{ll}(OSSF)$ (\ac{OSSF}). The first being the trilepton invariant mass 
and the latter being the dilepton invariant mass of the pair with \ac{OSSF}. In the case of more than one possible \ac{OSSF}-pair,
the pair with the highest invariant mass was chosen. Secondly I added variables composed of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta.
These variables include the sum of the transverse momenta of all three leptons, $H_T(lll)$, of the same sign lepton pair, $H_T(SS)$, and the sum of 
the momenta for all three leptons added with the missing transverse energy $H_T(lll) + E_T^{miss}$. Finally, I added the significance of the
$E_T^{miss}$, $S(E_T^{miss})$. The $S(E_T^{miss})$ is based on the log-likelihood ratio which compares the reconstructed $E_T^{miss}$ to 
the expected missing transverse energy in the case that there is no $E_T^{miss}$. For more information on $S(E_T^{miss})$ the reader is 
referred to \cite{object_based_2018}.
\subsection{Jet Variables}\label{subsec:JetSel}
Now we can have a look at the jet-features. Given that the final state of interest should be independent of jets, there are 
not many features added with jet information. But, given the risk of mis-identification, some jet features were included. The 
first features added were the number of jets, both all signal\footnote{See section \ref{subsec:Cuts}.} jets and number of b-jets.
B-jets are jets of particle originating from hadrons containing b-quarks. The information regarding the number of b-jets was divided into 
two columns based on the efficiency of a multivariate analysis used to separate jet-flavors. The efficiencies used for b-tagging are $77\%$ and $85\%$. 
The last information added for the jets were the mass of the leading pair (based on $p_t$) dijet mass, $m_{jj}$.
