\chapter{Implementation and Preliminary Work of the Analysis}\label{chap:Implementation}
Before starting my analysis and applying the set of \ac{ML} models, I first had to prepare the data set. This section 
will present the steps, tools and frameworks used in the preliminary work, as well as present the resulting feature distributions.
Towards the end of the chapter, I will present the different architectures for each model and the general strategy applied to training.
