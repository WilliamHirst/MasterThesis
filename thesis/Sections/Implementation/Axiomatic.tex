\chapter{Implementation $\&$ Preparation of the Analysis}\label{chap:Implementation}
Before starting my analysis and applying the set of \ac{ML} models, I first had to prepare the data set. This chapter 
will present the steps, tools and frameworks used in the preliminary work (and other aspects of the analysis), as well as present the 
resulting feature distributions. Towards the end of the chapter I will present the different architectures for each model and the general 
strategy applied to training. Note that all the code used to prepare and implement my analysis can be found in my \verb!Github!\footnote{
