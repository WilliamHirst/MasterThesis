\subsection{Phenomenology}
\ac{ML} differs from other analysis tools in its ability to
learn. Where a purely analytical model is static in both method 
and performance a \ac{ML} model aims to be dynamic and self 
improving. \ac{ML} utilizes data to leverage towards an ideal
model. The extent of utilization defines a \ac{ML} model as being
either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. In the case 
of supervised \ac{ML} a set of targets are provided along with the
data which allows a \ac{ML} model to map directly from data to target.
In the case of unsupervised \ac{ML}, no target is provided. Semi-unsupervised
is a loose term which finds it self in the middel of the previous two. 
It often refers to methods where no concrete target is provided, 
but instead uses the data provided to create a target
