\section{Statistical and multi-variabel analysis}
The main idea of the search is to define a region where we will compare
the \ac{MC}-background to the data and analyse any differences. Any analysis
in the signal region hopes to either discovery or exclude certain \ac{BSM}
physics. The standatd way of doing so is through statistics. In this rapport
the statistical analysis will not be the focus and will therefore not be
explained in heavy detail. Nonetheless a high-level understanding of the 
statistics is neccesarry when discussing the final results results. Therefore 
I will in this section discuss and define some basic statistical 
expressions and formulas.
