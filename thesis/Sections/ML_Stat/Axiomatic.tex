\chapter{Introduction to machine learning and statistical analysis}\label{chap:Intro ML}
Machine learning is rapidly becomming an overwhelming presens in many different scientific fields.
In areas ranging from cancer research to stock-trading, machine learning is being applied to probelms
once thought as impossible to solve. Particle physics, like many other fields is no exeption. Jet flavor classification \cite{Guest_2016}, 
separating jets from gluons \cite{PhysRevD.44.2025} or using \ac{ML} to create efficent \ac{SR} are just some examples
where \ac{ML} is a vital tool. The traditional approach for ML in high-energy physics is through the use 
of supperivsed learning. \ac{DNN}
