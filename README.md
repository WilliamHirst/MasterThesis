## Generating Data Set
Most of code used to prepare the data sets, i.e. apply cuts and generate features, can be found in the following file:

https://github.com/WilliamHirst/MasterThesis/blob/main/Codebase/DataPreparation/RDataFrameAna/MyRDataFrameAnalysis.py

This file requires requirementsROOT.txt 

## ML Analysis 
Most of code used to apply ML anlysis, both BDT and NN, can be found in the following folder:

https://github.com/WilliamHirst/MasterThesis/tree/main/Codebase/DataAnalysis

The files inside the NN folder require the requirmentsTF.txt software, and the files inside the XGBoost folder require requirmentsROOT.txt.

## Plotting Figures
Most of the code used to create the plots in my thesis can be found in the following folder:

https://github.com/WilliamHirst/MasterThesis/tree/main/Codebase/DataAnalysis/Plot_stuff

All files which install ROOT, requires the requirmentsROOT.txt software, otherwise use requirmentsTF.txt.

## Utilities 

Functions which are used in handling the data (apply PCA, scaling etc), calculating the significance or loading dataframes can be found in the utilities.py file:
