Ackowledgements: 

AB would like to thank the NExT Institute and SEPnet for partial financial 
support.  The work of  AB and AP was strongly supported by the Royal Society
grant JP090598. The work of NC was supported in part by the US National
Science Foundation under grant PHY-0354226, the LHC-TI initiative of the US 
National Science Foundation under grant PHY-0705682, the PITTsburgh Particle
physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology Center, and the US Department of Energy
under grant DE- FG02-12ER41832.

A large part of the recent developments in CalcHEP were motivated by requests
for the micrOMEGAs package which uses CalcHEP as a generator of matrix 
elements. We thank Genevieve Belanger and  Fawzi Boudjema for helpful comments
and suggestions in the development of CalcHEP.

CalcHEP  is also know for its succesful usage of various SM extensions  mainly
due to the pioneering work of Andrey Semenov in the development of the LanHEP
package which allows to realize rather complicated models in CalcHEP notation.
We are grateful to  Andrey Semenov for this job. 

NC would like to thank Fabio Maltoni and Claude Duhr for their support
in writing a CalcHEP output for the FeynRules package.

In 2009 AB and   AP  worked together at the Galileo Galilei Institute for 
Theoretical Physics where part of the CalcHEP development  was performed. 
We are grateful to GGI for  this opportunity. We are especially thankful to 
Maksym Bondarenko, the main author of the HEPMDB project
which has turned out to be very important for various web applications of 
CalcHEP.
  
We are grateful for many people who have tested CalcHEP, especially to 
Lorenzo Basso, Alexandra Carvalho, Joydeep Chakrabortty, Qing-Hong Cao, 
Mikhail Chizhov, Asesh Datta, Mads Frandsen, Renato Guedes, K.C.  Kong, 
Tomas Lastovicka,  Orlando Panella, Rui Santos, Chloe Papineau,  Marco Pruna, 
Patrik Svantesson,  Florian Staub,  Daniel Stolarski, Riccardo Torre,  
Izmail Turan and Alfonso Zerwekh.
