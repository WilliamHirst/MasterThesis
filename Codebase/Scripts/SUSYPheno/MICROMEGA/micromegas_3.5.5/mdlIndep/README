
Model-free calculation of DM  observables:

The input parameters are

    Mcdm[GeV]      -  DM mass;   
csSIp,csSIn,
csSDp,csSDn[pb]    -  cross sections for DM  spin dependent and  spin independent scattering 
                      on proton and neutron. A negative value for one of these
                      cross sections is interpreted as a destructive interference 
                      between the neutron/proton amplitudes in calculating the DM-nucleus cross section.  

   vsc [pb]        -  DM annihilation cross section times velocity for collision at rest.
                      
   pdgCH           -  array of PDG codes for different annihilation channels 

   fracCH          -  array of relative  contribution of the channels in pdgCH
                      to the total annihilation cross section. 

The file main.c/F  contains an example of the calculation of the direct detection,  indirect detection
and neutrino telescope signals for a self conjugated DM particle (like the neutralino). 
The numerical input data in this sample file corresponds to 'MSSM/mssmh.dat'.
