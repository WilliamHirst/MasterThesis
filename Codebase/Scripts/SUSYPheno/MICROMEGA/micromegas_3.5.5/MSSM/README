The MSSM can be treated in 4 different models with input parameters defined either at the GUT scale or the weak scale. To define the model one has to uncomment one of the lines near the top of the main.c/F files,  

#define SUGRA   
   The parameters of the CMSSM 
      m0      common scalar mass at GUT scale
      mhf     common gaugino mass at GUT scale
      a0      trilinear soft breaking parameter at GUT scale
      tb      tan(beta) 
   are specified via a command line:
               ./main m0 mhf a0 tb 
   in addition, some auxiliary parameters can be defined to replace the default
   values:
      sgn     +/-1,  sign of Higgsino mass term (default 1)
      Mtp     top quark pole mass
      MbMb    Mb(Mb) scale independent b-quark mass
      alfSMZ  strong coupling at MZ

      
#define SUGRANUH  
   The parameters of the CMSSM with non-universal Higgs condition include those of the 
   SUGRA switch as well as two parameters of the Higgs sector defined at the EWSB scale  
      mu(EWSB)                 
      MH3 pole mass of all odd Higgs
             ./main m0 mhf a0 tb  mu MH3 

#define AMSB     
   The input parameters of the Anomaly-Mediated Symmetry Breaking model are                
      m0      common scalar mass at GUT scale
      m3/2    gravitino mass
      tb      tan(beta) 
             ./main m0 m3/2 tb 
      The Auxiliary parameters listed above for SUGRA can also be added to the
      command line    
  
#define EWSB    
   The input parameters of the pMSSM  are defined at the SUSY scale and read from a file
   specified in the command line:
                  ./main mssm1.par

If all these definitions are commented  ./main will read a Les Houches spectrum file (SLHA)
to be specified  in the command line:

                     ./main suspect2_out.lha

In general ./main launched without parameters explains which parameters are  needed.

By default SuSpect is used to compute the particle spectrum with loop corrections. The SuSpect 
code is attached to micrOMEGAs  and  located in the  directory Packages.   To use other
programs (SPHENO, SOFTSUSY, ISAJET) for spectrum generation  one has to define the path
to the corresponding package in lib/Makefile and  define the  switch RGE in main.c/main.F
#define RGE  suspect
     /* choose 'suspect','isajet','softSusy','spheno'*/
