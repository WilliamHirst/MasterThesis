The *.src files contains the definition of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
in the LanHEP format. To process those files you need to install LanHEP 

     http://theory.sinp.msu.ru/~semenov/lanhep.html

For running LanHEP use

            lhep startup.src -evl 2

This will transform thes source files  into CalcHEP model files which 
can then be used in CalcHEP or micrOMEGAs  for calculating cross sections and 
Dark Matter related observables. The output should be four files (varsX.mdl   
funcX.mdl prtclsX.mdl and lgrngX.mdl) which specify the model in the
CalcHEP format. Here X could be 1,2, or 3 depending 
on switches in the 'startup.src' file. See arXiv:1008.0181 for details.
