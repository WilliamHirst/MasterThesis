HOW TO USE NMSSMTOOLS:

After the download of NMSSMTools_x.tgz (where x is the version
number), type "tar zxvf NMSSMTools_x.tgz". This will create a directory
named NMSSMTools_x.
Go into this directory. 
There you find the directories 
-- "sources", "main" and "micromegas_2.2", which contain source files;
-- "EXPCON", which contains data files corresponding to experimental
    constraints;
-- "SAMPLES", which contains sample input and output files; 
-- "BMPSUGRA" contains mSUGRA-like benchmark points as in
    A. Djouadi et al., arXiv:0801.4321 [hep-ph];
-- "BMPGMSB" contains GMSB-like benchmark points as in  
    U. Ellwanger et al., arXiv:0803.2962 [hep-ph].
-- "BMPLHC" contains benchmark points with a SM-like Higgs with a mass
    around 125 GeV

 
COMPILATION:
    
To compile, type first "make init", then "make". A first compilation
may take a while, since all subroutines of micromegas_2.2 are compiled.
The following 8 executable routines are created in the directory
"main": nmhdecay, nmhdecay_rand, nmhdecay_grid, nmspec, nmspec_rand,
nmspec_grid, nmgmsb and nmgmsb_rand.
If a subroutine in the directory "sources" was modified, one has to
type "make init" and "make" again. If a routine in the directory "main"
was modified, it suffices to type "make" again.
To delete all the already compiled codes type "make clean".

INPUT FILES:

From the version 2.0.0 onwards, the task to be performed by an input
file is independent from its name. Any name is allowed, provided it
contains the three letters "inp"; it can be of the general form
PREFIXinpSUFFIX where PREFIX and SUFFIX can contain dots etc..

The input file can be located in any directory specified by a PATH.

To run any input file PREFIXinpSUFFIX, type "run PATH/PREFIXinpSUFFIX".
(PATH is optional; if absent, the input file has to be located in the
same directory as the script file "run".)

The output files are located in the directory specified by PATH.
They have the following format: 
If one single point in the parameter space is evaluated:
   PREFIXspectrSUFFIX, PREFIXdecaySUFFIX, and
   PREFIXomegaSUFFIX (if the relic density is computed, see below)
If scans are performed:
   PREFIXerrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXoutSUFFIX 

However, the task to be performed by an input file must be specified in
the BLOCK MODSEL at the beginning (see the SLHA2 conventions in 
B. Allanach et al., SUSY Les Houches Accord 2, arXiv:0801.0045
[hep-ph]).

The BLOCK MODSEL should contain the following four lines:

BLOCK MODSEL
	3	1		# NMSSM PARTICLE CONTENT
	1	I1		# IMOD (0=general NMSSM, 1=mSUGRA, 2=GMSB)
	10	I2		# ISCAN (0=no scan, 1=grid scan, 2=random scan, 3=MCMC)
	9	I3		# Call micrOmegas (default 0=no, 1=relic density only,
#				  2=dir. det. rate, 3=indir. det. rate, 4=both det. rates)
	8       I4		# Precision for Higgs masses (default 0: as before,
#				  1: full 1 loop + full 2 loop from top/bot Yukawas
#				  2: as 1 + pole masses - 1&2 by courtesy of P. Slavich)
	13      I5		# 1: Sparticle decays via NMSDECAY

The meaning of the five integers I1, I2, I3, I4 and I5 is as follows:

I1=0: general NMSSM with parameters specified at the SUSY breaking scale
      (an average of the squark masses, unless specified by the user).
      As in the previous versions of NMSSMTools, the input parameters
      have to be given in the BLOCK EXTPAR following the SLHA2
      conventions.
      See the example in SAMPLES/inp.dat.

I1=1: mSUGRA-like boundary conditions at the GUT scale with universal
      scalar masses m0, gaugino masses M12 and trilinear couplings A0
      (to be specified in the BLOCK MINPAR).
      See the example in SAMPLES/inpsp.dat.

I1=2: GMSB-like boundary conditions as in the paper U. Ellwanger et al.,
      arXiv:0803.2962 [hep-ph].
      See the example in SAMPLES/inpgm.dat.

I2=0: One single point in parameter space is evaluated. Detailed
      informations on the spectrum, mixing angles, the satisfaction of
      theoretical and experimental constraints are given in the output
      file PREFIXspectrSUFFIX, detailed informations on the partial
      decay widths of all six Higgs states in PREFIXdecaySUFFIX.

I2=1: A scan over a grid in parameter space is performed. The
      boundaries in parameter space as well as the corresponding
      numbers of steps have to be specified. 
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/gridinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/gridinpsp.dat.
      For possible scans with GMSB-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/gridinpgm.dat
      
      The output file PREFIXerrSUFFIX gives the number of points which
      have passed all constraints, and the corresponding range of input
      parameters.
      The output file PREFIXoutSUFFIX contains details of points which
      have passed constraints; the latter can be modified by the user
      by editing the corresponding routines in the directory "main":
      
      The output file PREFIXoutSUFFIX is created in the subroutine
      OUTPUT near the end of the file nmhdecay_grid.f (general NMSSM),
      or nmspec_grid.f (mSUGRA) or nmgmsb_grid.f (GMSB). 
      If the first line in the subroutine OUTPUT reads
      "IF(IFAIL.EQ.0)THEN", properties of points with phenomenological
      problems are not written into PREFIXoutSUFFIX.
      If this line reads "IF(IFAIL.EQ.0 .OR. IFAIL.EQ.10)THEN", points
      with phenomenological problems are written as well. 
      The properties which are listed in PREFIXoutSUFFIX depend on the
      second argument of the array RES(IDIM,I) and should be specified
      by the user.
      The meaning of the various arrays containing Higgs and sparticle
      masses and mixing angles, Higgs branching ratios is given at the
      beginning of the file nmhdecay_grid.f (general NMSSM), 
      nmspec_grid.f (mSUGRA) or nmspec_grid.f (GMSB). For convenience,
      we list the content of the array PAR(I) (the couplings and soft
      terms at the SUSY scale) as well as the content of the array
      PROB(I) (phenomenological and some theoretical constraints)
      below.

I2=2: A random scan in parameter space is performed. The boundaries in
      parameter space as well as the total number of steps have to be
      specified. 
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/randinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/randinpsp.dat.
      For possible scans with GMSB-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/randinpgm.dat
      
      For the content of the output files PREFIXerrSUFFIX and
      PREFIXoutSUFFIX (and the treatment of the latter) see the
      description of the case I2=2 above; the corresponding MAIN
      routines for random scans in the directory "main" are denoted by
      nmhdecay_rand.f, nmspec_rand.f and nmgmsb_rand.f.
      
I2=3: A Markov Chain Monte Carlo scan in parameter space is performed.
      The boundaries as well as the relative size of each step for all
      parameters and the total number of steps have to be specified.
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/mcmcinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/mcmcinpsp.dat.
      For possible scans with GMSB-like boundary conditions see the
      examples SAMPLES/mcmcinpgm.dat.
      
      For the content of the output files PREFIXerrSUFFIX and
      PREFIXoutSUFFIX (and the treatment of the latter) see the
      description of the case I2=2 above; the corresponding MAIN
      routine for a MCMC scans in the directory "main" are denoted by
      nmhdecay_mcmc.f, nmspec_mcmc.f and nmgmsb_mcmc.f.
      
I3=0: The dark matter relic density is not computed.

I3=1: The dark matter relic density is computed and checked via a call
      of micromegas. This option is not possible for GMSB-like
      boundary conditions. A first call of micromegas provokes the
      compilation of additional subroutines, which may take a while.
      
      In the case of a single point in parameter space (I2=0), the
      relic density Omega*h^2 is given in the output files
      PREFIXspectrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXomegaSUFFIX. The latter
      contains in addition informations on the decomposition of the
      LSP and the relevant annihilation/coannihilation processes.
      The names of particles in the final states of the annihilation
      and coannihilation processes are the same as in micrOMEGAS and
      can be found in: G. Belanger, F. Boudjema, A. Pukhov and A. Semenov,
      micrOMEGAs: A program for calculating the relic density
      in the MSSM, Comput. Phys. Commun. 149 (2002) 103
      [arXiv:hep-ph/0112278].
      
I3=2: Same as I3=1 + direct detection cross sections are computed.
      In the case of a single point in parameter space (I2=0), the
      BLOCK NDMCROSSSECT in PREFIXomegaSUFFIX contains:
      csPsi = proton  spin-independent cross section in [pb]
      csNsi = neutron spin-independent cross section in [pb]
      csPsd = proton  spin-dependent   cross section in [pb]
      csNsd = neutron spin-dependent   cross section in [pb]

I3=3: Same as I3=1 + the thermally averaged LSP annihilation cross section
      as well as the resulting photon spectrum are computed. In the case of
      a single point in parameter space (I2=0), these are written in the
      BLOCK ANNIHILATION of PREFIXomegaSUFFIX:
      sigmaV = LSP annihilation cross section,

I3=4: Same as I3=2+3.

Precision of the CP-even/odd/charged Higgs masses:

I4=0: 1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
              contributions ~ g1, g2, lambda and kappa to LLA
	      for the SM-like CP-even Higgs only
      2-loop: top/bottom Yukawa contributions to LLA
I4=1: as in G. Degrassi, P. Slavich, Nucl.Phys.B825:119-150,2010, 
      arXiv:0907.4682 (with special thanks to P. Slavich);
      corrections to the charged Higgs mass from K.H.Phan and P. Slavich:
      1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
              complete contributions ~g1, g2, lambda and kappa
	      (except for pole masses)
      2-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
I4=2: 1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
              complete contributions ~g1, g2, lambda and kappa
	      including pole masses (slow!)
      2-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas

Sparticle total widths and branching ratios:

I5=0: Not computed

I5=1: NMSDECAY is called, which computes sparticle 2-body and 3-body
      branching ratios as in
      SDECAY: A Fortran code for the decays of the supersymmetric 
	 particles in the MSSM
      by M. Muhlleitner (Karlsruhe, Inst. Technol.),
        A. Djouadi (Orsay, LPT & CERN, Theory Division),
        Y. Mambrini (Orsay, LPT),
      Comput.Phys.Commun.168:46-70 (2005), hep-ph/0311167.
     SDECAY should be cited whenever NMSDECAY is used.
     In NMSDECAY.f in the directory sources, the flags 
        "flagmulti" (3-body decays)
        "flagqcd" (QCD corrections to 2-body decays)
        "flagloop" (loop decays)
     can be switched off; otherwise a call of NMSDECAY takes about 2-3 seconds
     per point in parameter space.
     In the versions nmhdecay.f and nmspec.f, the sparticle widths and BR's are
     appended to the output file PREFIXdecaySUFFIX in SLHA2 format. If scans are
     performed, the user can use the arguments of the COMMON statements in the
     subroutines OUTPUT in order to define the content of the output file.

      PAR(1) = lambda

(If all are commented, MA is computed assuming ALAMBDA=XIF=0,
if only MA is input, ALAMBDA is computed assuming XIF=0,
if only ALAMBDA is input, MA is computed assuming XIF=0,
if only XIF is input, MA is computed assuming ALMBDA=0)

Options for the parameter set "AKAPPA, MP, XIS" where
MP=diagonal singlet-singlet entry in the CP-odd mass matrix:
Two out of these three parameters have to be specified,
the remaining one is computed.
(If all are commented, MP is computed assuming AKAPPA=XIS=0,
if only MP is input, AKAPPA is computed assuming XIS=0,
if only AKAPPA is input, MP is computed assuming XIS=0,
if only XIS is input, MP is computed assuming AKAPPA=0)

Note: If KAPPA=0, AKAPPA must be =0

In the output file, the values of the computed parameters are
shown in the BLOCK EXTPAR, but commented.

PARTICULAR CASES:

Z_3-invariant NMSSM:
Always to specify: TANB, LAMBDA, MUEFF, KAPPA, and in addition
- either ALAMBDA or MA, and
- either AKAPPA or MP.
If too many of these latter parameters are specified, XIF and/or XIS
are computed and indicated in the output.

nMSSM (kappa=Akappa=0, but XIF, XIS non-vanishing):
Always to specify: TANB, LAMBDA, MUEFF, and in addition
- two parameters of the set (XIF, ALAMBDA, MA), the remaining parameter
is computed, and
- MP or XIS, the remaining parameter is computed.

INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMHDECAY_RAND:

Scans can be performed over all independent parameters of the Higgs
sector (see above), and the gaugino masses M1, M2 and M3. If M1 and/or
M3 are not specified, M1=M2/2 and M3=3*M2.

For each parameter "P", P_max=P_min if P_max is not specified.
P_min=0 by default, except for TANB, LAMBDA and MUEFF which have to be
specified, and except for the parameters which are computed.
Unless P_min=0 by default, P_max cannot be given if P_min is not known.
(If KAPPA=0, AKAPPA is set = 0.)

The user has to specify the total number of points.

INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMHDECAY_GRID:

The choice of independent parameters is as above.
The user has to specify the number of points "NP" for each parameter
to be scanned. By default NP=1. If P_max > P_min and NP=1, P_min is
used. If P_max=P_min and NP>1, the user is alerted by a warning.


INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMSPEC:

The user has to specify TANB, LAMBDA, M0, M12 (unless all M1, M2 and M3
are specified separately) and A0.
ALAMBDA and AKAPPA (both at MGUT) can be specified independently from
A0, if desired.
MHD^2 and MHU^2 (both at MGUT) can be specified independently from m0,
if MUEFF is NOT specified.

Default values for all other parameters (unless computed in terms of
others) are =0.

By default, KAPPA is computed in terms of the other parameters. If KAPPA
is input: XIF is computed and hence =/= 0 in general. If neither KAPPA
nor XIF are given as inputs then KAPPA is computed assuming XIF=0. Both
parameters cannot be simultaneously inputs.

By default, the singlet soft mass MS^2 at MGUT is computed in terms of
the other parameters and hence =/= m0 in general. If MS^2 is input, XIS
is computed instead and hence =/= 0 in general. If neither MS^2 nor XIS
are given as inputs then MS^2 is computed assuming XIS=0. Both
parameters cannot be simultaneously inputs.

By default, MUEFF is computed in terms of the other parameters, but then
its sign SIGMU (FLOAT, not INTEGER) must be given.

If MUEFF is an input parameter, KAPPA, XIF and XIS are also interpreted
as input parameter (with default value =0 unless specified otherwise).
Then the Higgs soft masses MHD^2, MHU^2 and MS^2 at MGUT are computed in
terms of the other parameters and hence =/= m0 in general.

By default, XIF=XIS=MU'=MS'^2=M3H^2=0, but can be specified otherwise
(at MGUT).
Exceptions: If MUEFF is NOT an input parameter and
- if KAPPA is input: XIF is computed and hence =/= 0 in general;
- if MS^2 is input: XIS is computed and hence =/= 0 in general.

PARTICULAR CASES:

cNMSSM (fully constrained Z_3-invariant NMSSM): Not possible as input;
at least MS^2 at MGUT is an output

sNMSSM (semi-constrained Z_3-invariant NMSSM, with non-universal singlet
sector):
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, M0, M12, A0, ALAMBDA, AKAPPA
-> KAPPA, MUEFF and MS^2 are computed.

NUH-NMSSM (Z_3-invariant NMSSM with non-universal Higgs masses MS^2,
MHD^2 and MHU^2 at MGUT):
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA, AKAPPA),
MUEFF
-> MS^2, MHD^2 and MHU^2 are computed.

nMSSM (no self coupling for the singlet): 
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA=AKAPPA=0, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA), XIS
-> XIF, MUEFF, MS^2 are computed;
or
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA=AKAPPA=0, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA), MS^2
-> XIF, MUEFF, XIS are computed.
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA=AKAPPA=0, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA), MUEFF, XIF, XIS
-> MHU^2, MHD^2, MS^2 are computed.

INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMSPEC_RAND:

Scans can be performed over all independent parameters (as above).
For each parameter "P", P_max=P_min if P_max is not specified,
P_max cannot be given if P_min is not known.
Same default value assumed for P_min as for P.
The user has to specify the total number of points.

INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMSPEC_GRID:

The choice of independent parameters is as above.
The user has to specify the number of points "NP" for each parameter
to be scanned. By default NP=1. If P_max > P_min and NP=1, P_min is
used. If P_max=P_min and NP>1, the user is alerted by a warning.


INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMGMSB:

The definitions of the parameters specific to GMSB models
can be found in JHEP 0805 (2008) 044 (arXiv:0803.2962).

The user has to specify TANB, LAMBDA, MSUSY (SUSY scale), MMESS
(messenger scale) N5 (number of 5-plets) and SIGMU (sign of MUEFF which
is always computed). ALAMBDA (at MMESS) can be specified if =/=0. AKAPPA
is always =3*ALAMBDA.

Default values for all other parameters (unless computed in terms of
others) are =0.

By default, KAPPA is computed in terms of the other parameters. If KAPPA
is input: XIF is computed and hence =/= 0 in general. If neither KAPPA
nor XIF are given as inputs then KAPPA is computed assuming XIF=0. Both
parameters cannot be simultaneously inputs.

By default, the singlet soft mass MS^2 at MGUT is computed in terms of
the other parameters. If MS^2 is input, XIS is computed instead and
hence =/= 0 in general. If neither MS^2 nor XIS are given as inputs then
MS^2 is computed assuming XIS=0. Both parameters cannot be
simultaneously inputs.

By default, XIF=XIS=MU'=MS'^2=DELTA_H=0, but can be specified otherwise (at MMESS).
- if KAPPA is input: XIF is computed and hence =/= 0 in general;
- if MS^2 is input: XIS is computed and hence =/= 0 in general.

INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMGMSB_RAND:

Scans can be performed over all independent parameters (as above).

INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMGMSB_GRID:

The choice of independent parameters is as above.
The user has to specify the number of points "NP" for each parameter
to be scanned. By default NP=1. If P_max > P_min and NP=1, P_min is
