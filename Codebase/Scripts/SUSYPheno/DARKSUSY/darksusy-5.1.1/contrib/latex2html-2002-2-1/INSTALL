LaTeX2HTML 99.2 Installation Manual
===================================

The installation procedure has changed substantially from version 98.3 on.
It now resembles more closely the GNU installation scheme, while providing
alternatives for Win32 and OS/2 users.

Step by step cookbook
=====================

A. UNIX
-------

(Win 95, 98, NT and OS/2 users see below)

0. Unpacking

Unpack the tar file into a temporary area. This has changed: Do not unpack
the tar file to the final desired location (e.g. /usr/local/latex2html).
Read the INSTALL file. Oops, you are already here...

1. Configuring

You may have a look at the prefs.pm preferences file. It is preset with 
reasonable defaults. Edit it to adapt the configuration procedure, e.g. if
your executables like latex, gs etc. have "strange" names (e.g., "LaTeX").

Run

   ./configure --help

This gives you a brief overview of configuration options. Note that for
each --enable-someting there is also a --disable-something. Anyway, the
defaults are reasonable and robust, so you should give it a first try
with only specifying the --prefix (see below) if you don't like /usr/local.

configure looks also at the environment, so that you could hardcode the path
to your Ghostscript executable by e.g. (on bourne shell!)

  GS=/opt/ghostscript/bin/gs ./configure 

Alternatively you could say (works on all shells)

  ./configure --with-gs=/opt/ghostscript/bin/gs

Note for --prefix: The final directory structure depends on the name of the
prefix:

- if prefix contains the string "latex2html" or "l2h":
  Then binaries go into $prefix/bin, while the rest goes into $prefix

- prefix does *not* contain the above strings:
  Then binaries go into $prefix/bin and the rest into $prefix/lib/latex2html

You can override the settings by specifying --bindir and/or --libdir.
Note that currently no other path/installation options in configure (e.g.
--exec-prefix, --sbindir, --datadir, ...) are recognized. This may change
in the future.

After configure has completed, you may check the cfgcache.pm file if 
everything is ok. It contains all the information gathered from your system
and there should be no need to change anything. Exceptions from this rule
can be considered bugs in the configuration procedure. :-)

Note: The GNU autoconf-generated configure script hands execution over
to a Perl script. This of course isn't the "clean" way. I know that, but
the configure procedure should work also on native Win/OS2/Mac systems that
(by default) lack sh, make, etc.

2. Building

Run "make". The distribution files (extension .pin) are turned into the
locally adapted scripts, using the configuration from cfgcache.pm. If you
need to change things, then re-run the configuration step with the 
appropriate options (preferred) or edit the cfgcache.pm file and run "make"
again.

3. Testing

Do a plausibility check: "make check". The perl scripts are checked for
syntax correctness. For compiling a small test document, type "make test".
The test example is located in the "tests" subdirectory. You may specify
additional command line arguments by saying "make test ARGS='...'".
You may test LaTeX2HTML manually on one of your documents by setting the
LATEX2HTMLDIR environment to the path where "Makefile" is located and 
running latex2html with the option -test_mode.
Alternatively, you may put your document in the tests/ directory and run
"make test TESTCASE=yourfile.tex"

4. Installing

Install LaTeX2HTML in its final location by saying "make install".
Before doing that you might want to edit l2hconf.pm to reflect your 
site-wide needs. If you do a system installation for many users, only 
care for general aspects. Note that at any time these settings are easily
overridden by specifying command line options to the latex2html script
or by installing a .latex2html-init file in the HOME directory.
Read the instructions about ICONSERVER carefully to make sure your
HTML documents will be displayed right via the Web server.
While you're at it you may want to change some of the default
options in the same file. 

5. Cleaning up

You may remove the temporary directory to which you unpacked the
distribution after installation.

6. Bug reports

When reporting bugs, it may be a good idea to send the cfgcache.pm file
as a reference of your local setup. Re-run the configuration procedure
if you don't have the file any more. See also the BUGS file.

See below "Further General Aspects" for information on useful site-wide
configuration.


B. DOS, Win32, OS/2
-------------------

0. Unpacking

Unpack the tar file into a temporary area. This has changed: Do not unpack
the tar file to the final desired location (e.g. /usr/local/latex2html).
Read the INSTALL file. Oops, you are already here...

On OS/2, rename CONFIG.BAT to CONFIG.CMD and modfify the PERL environment
setting (in CONFIG.CMD) in the following way:

set PERL=perl_

This is needed because this "version" of the Perl executable has some
additional features that are required by LaTeX2HTML.
If you want to make use of the Makefiles on OS/2 (this works if you have
the GNU utilities installed), then you should include a line

SHELL=.../sh.exe

with ... being the path to the bourne shell executable. Thanks to 
Uli Wortmann for this hint.

1. Configuring

Edit the prefs.pm file to adapt the configuration for your site. You
should not have to change much apart from the path where LaTeX2HTML should
be installed on your system. The executables are found automatically if
located in the directories specified in your PATH environment. If your perl
interpreter is not named "perl" or if you have more than one perl installed,
you should edit CONFIG.BAT (or CONFIG.CMD on OS/2, in the following CONFIG.*
is used for brevity) and specify the exact path to your (desired) perl
interpreter.
If you have just installed some of the required external utilities and
have not yet added the paths to the PATH environment, you may specify
the argument EXTRAPATH+... (e.g. EXTRAPATH+C:\tex\bin;C:\netpbm\bin) on
the CONFIG.* command line to indicate additional search paths.

Now you may run CONFIG.*
Example that also sets the installation root directory without editing 
prefs.pm:

   CONFIG.BAT PREFIX+C:\latex2html

You can also say PREFIX=C:\latex2html but my COMMAND.COM eats the `=' :-(

Make sure that you have enough space for the environment. If you get
error messages "no space left in environment" or the like, either increase
the space for the environment in your CONFIG.SYS or (temporarily) run
a new shell with "command /e:2000" (for 2k space for environment).
After configure has completed, you may check the cfgcache.pm file (if
you are curious).

2. Building

Not really an extra step. After successful configuration the distribution files
(extension .pin) are automatically turned into the locally adapted scripts
automatically, using the settings found in the previous step.

3. Testing

The CONFIG.* script created a TEST.BAT (TEST.CMD on OS/2) file that
compiles a small test document located in the "tests" subdirectory.
You may specify additional LaTeX2HTML options (up to arguments) on the
TEST.* command line.

You can test LaTeX2HTML yourself with your own documents by setting the
LATEX2HTMLDIR environment to the path where CONFIG.* is located and running
latex2html by saying "latex2html -test_mode <filename>.tex". It may be
necessary that that you need to add the directory where latex2html.bat is
stored to your PATH environment.

4. Installing

Install LaTeX2HTML in its final location by running INSTALL.BAT 
(INSTALL.CMD on OS/2).

5. Cleaning up

You may remove the temporary directory to which you unpacked the
distribution. All required files have been copied to the installation
directory.

6. Bug reports

When reporting bugs, it may be a good idea to send the cfgcache.pm file
as a reference of your local setup. Re-run the configuration procedure
if you don't have the file any more. See the BUGS file for more details.

Further General Aspects
=======================

This is enough for the main installation but you may also want to do some of
the following: 

 o If your system supports both GIF and PNG generation (this is if you have 
   both pnmtopng and ppmtogif), then the default image format will be PNG.
   This is because of legal limitations on the GIF format. To set the
   site-wide default to GIF, modify the order of the image formats in
   l2hconf.pm *before* you install:

     @IMAGE_TYPES = qw(gif png); # GIF is now default

   Alternatively, you may say "-image_type gif" on the command line or
   $IMAGE_TYPE = 'gif' in your .latex2html-init file.

 o To use the new LaTeX commands which are defined in html.sty: 
   Make sure that LaTeX knows where the html.sty file is, either by
   putting it in the same place as the other style files on your system, or
   by changing your TEXINPUTS shell environment variable, or by
   copying html.sty in the same directory as as your LaTeX source file. 
   The installation procedure tries to install these files into your TeX
   directory tree if present.

 o If you are a LaTeX 2.09 user, you will not be able to use
   the document segmentation feature, or the optional arguments to
   \htmladdimg, until you upgrade to LaTeX2e.
   (This will also rule out many of the HTML3/HTML4 features!)
   To determine which version you have, type just 'latex'.
   If it prompts with '(C version 6.1)', you have LaTeX2e. Anyway, if you're
   not sure, ask the people who installed it.
   However you *mustn't* upgrade LaTeX just to have the features, lots of
   documents do fine without them.
   You should not try to translate manual.tex with LaTeX 2.09. Instead,
   invoke LaTeX2HTML with manual.tex directly.

 o On some systems, the command ``latex'' is really a shell script which sets
   some environment variables and calls the real LaTeX. If this is so, make
   sure that this shell script has '.' and '..' set for TEXINPUTS.
   This environment variable is not to be confused with the LaTeX2HTML
   installation variable $TEXINPUTS described next.

 o The installation variable HTML_VERSION in latex2html.config causes
   LaTeX2HTML to generate table in HTML and supports textual font
   size changes if it is set to 3.0.  Otherwise, tables will be
   processes in LaTeX and come out as GIF files.

 o There is an installation variable in l2hconf.pm
   called $TEXINPUTS, which tells LaTeX2HTML where to
   look for LaTeX input files to process. This variable is
   appended to the TEXINPUTS environment variable to make sure the
   translator finds all your files.

 o The installation variable $PK_GENERATION specifies which
   fonts are used in the generation of mathematical equations.  A value
   of ``0'' causes the same fonts to used as those for the default
   printer.  Because they were designed for a printer of much greater
   resolution than the screen, equations will generally appear to be
   of a lower quality than is possible.  To cause LaTeX2HTML to
   dynamically generate fonts that are designed specifically for the
   screen, you should specify a value of ``1'' for this variable.
   If you do, then check to see whether your version of dvips
   supports the command line option -mode.  If it does,
   then also set the installation variable $DVIPS_MODE to
   a low resolution entry from modes.mf, such as `toshiba'.
   If dvips does not support the -mode switch, then leave $DVIPS_MODE
   undefined, and verify that the .dvipsrc file points to the
   correct screen device and its resolution.

 o The makemap script also has a configuration variable,
   $SERVER, which must be set to either "CERN" or "NCSA", depending
   on the type of web server you are using.

 o To set up different initialisation files: 
   For a ``per user'' initialisation file, copy the file 
   dot.latex2html-init in the home directory of any user that
   wants it, modify it according to her preferences and rename it as 
   .latex2html-init. At runtime, both the 
   latex2html.config file and $HOME/.latex2html-init
   file will be loaded, but the latter will take precedence. 

   You can also set up a ``per directory'' initialisation file by copying a
   version of .latex2html-init in each directory you would like it
   to be effective. An initialisation file 
   /X/Y/Z/.latex2html-init will take precedence over all
   other initialisation files if /X/Y/Z is the ``current directory'' when 
   LaTeX2HTML is invoked. 

 o To find the LaTeX2HTML icons:
   The LaTeX2HTML icons are fetched through $ICONSERVER. This variable
   should point to a global URL on your system. The icons are installed in
   $LATEX2HTMLDIR/icons, but you must configure your HTTP daemon to find
   them. You can configure an alias in HTTPd's config files or you may
   set up a symbolic link. Whatever you do, make sure that $ICONSERVER
   is the URL below which the server finds the icons.
   Make sure they can be *read* by your HTTP daemon, ie. set the directory
   world-wide readable/executable and the icons world-wide readable and
   the HTTP daemon finds the icons under the $ICONSERVER URL.
   If $LATEX2HTMLDIR is something private for you, copy the icons to a
   global place, say /usr/local/lib/latex2html/icons, and set $ICONSERVER
   accordingly. Note that by setting $LOCAL_ICONS or using the
   -local_icons command line switch you can force LaTeX2HTML to copy the
   icons to the document directory, thus resulting in a self-contained
   document tree that can be dropped into any existing directory
   structure.

 o To make your own local copy of the LaTeX2HTML documentation: 
   This will also be a good test of your installation. To do it run
   LaTeX2HTML on the file doc/manual.tex. You will get better results if
   you run LaTeX first on the same file in order to create some auxiliary
   files. 


Common Pitfalls, FAQ
====================

1. Q: What versions of the external programs are recommended?

   A: General remark: The config procedure automatically checks all your
      PATH for the required executables. You'll have only to take action if
      some components are not recognized. As far as Linux is concerned,
      the major distributions (SuSE, Red Hat, Debian, Slackware) all have
      packages with the following tools. Just install them and LaTeX2HTML
      should be happy.

      Perl        : 5.00305 or higher (5.00503 recommended)
      TeX, LaTeX  : teTeX 0.4 or higher (1.0 recommended), Web2C
      Ghostscript : 4.03 or higher (5.x recommended)
      Netpbm      : 1mar1994p1
                    The "p1" *is* important: This version fixes a bug in
                    pnmcrop that makes pstoimg leave black bars around the
                    images. The configure procedure tests automatically for
                    this feature.
      Pnmtopng    : 2.31 or higher (for PNG image generation)

2. Q: Where can I get all those external programs?

   A: Perl        : http://www.perl.com (all platforms)
      TeX, LaTeX  : any CTAN site, see XXX for a list of sites
      Ghostscript : http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html
      Netpbm      : http://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/
      Pnmtopng    : http://www.graphicswiz.com/png/index.html

      Win32 users will find all they need at Fabrice Popineau's fine
      TeX site ftp://ftp.ese-metz.fr/pub/TeX/win32

3. Q: What about perl 4 compatibility and perl 5 versions less than
      5.00305?

   A: Forget perl 4. Perl 5 is out for years now, it is available for
      more platforms than perl 4 ever was and it is stable and it is
      being maintained.
      The early perl 5 versions (esp. 001 and 002) are known to have nasty
      bugs that cause severe problems with LaTeX2HTML. Update to a more
      recent version (5.00503 recommended).

4. Q: I've installed the external programs, but the configure procedure
      doesn't recognize that.

   A: You either have not sufficient access rights or - more probably -
      you need to add some paths to your PATH environment. You may do that
      on the fly, i.e. set PATH manually and run the configure step again.
      The absolute paths are saved, so that LaTeX2HTML will run ok even if
      you don't have all the additional PATH settings coded into your 
      .profile, .bashrc, .(t)cshrc, AUTOEXEC.BAT, etc...
      Finally there is the --with-extrapath=... configure option or
      EXTRAPATHH+... for CONFIG.BAT

5. Q: On Win/DOS/OS2 I get messages of the type "no more space in
      environment". What's wrong?

   A: Your command interpreter (COMMAND.COM) does not provide sufficient
      space for environment variables. Try to run a new one with:

      COMMAND.COM /e:2000

      Now you should have 2k space for environment variables. You may
      specify this value in CONFIG.SYS:

      SHELL=<path>COMMAND.COM /e:2000

      (or somehow using

      COMSPEC=<path>COMMAND.COM /e:2000

      Sorry for that, maybe some can supply the correct answer?!?)

6. Q: What is this "EPS support" with dvips all about?

   A: Recent versions of dvips(k) (5.60 and higher) have the possibility
      to create many EPS files out of one multi-page DVI file by exploiting

                  -E (EPSF generation)
                  -i (separate file for every section)
                  -S 1 (section size is one page)

      The idea behind it is that once dvips has produced EPS files with a
      proper bounding box, Ghostscript's memory requirements are reduced
      noticeably.

      CAVEAT: dvips does not handle specials (like psfig, includegraphics)
      perfectly in the context of EPS, see also the dvips texinfo. You may
      experience difficulties when you process a document that includes
      EPS images. In this case, don't use the `-E' switch and/or reconfigure
      latex2html with --disable-eps

7. Q: I get "out of memory" messages although I have plenty of RAM and/or
      swap space (virtual memory) - what's wrong?

   A: Unfortunately LaTeX2HTML is quite hungry for memory. This is one of
      the main areas of improvement that is being worked upon constantly.
      In order to run LaTeX2HTML anyway, be sure to close any other 
      applications before starting LaTeX2HTML.
      Another possible problem is that your system has a hard per-process
      memory limit. If so, ask the system administrator to relax this
      value. Note: On HP-UX, this is done by setting the MAXDSIZ, MAXSSIZ, 
      MAXTSIZ kernel parameters (thanks Andre Konopka <ak@presse-data.de>).

8. Q: What's the problem with the GIF image format?

   A: Unisys holds a patent on the LZW compression algorithm that is used
      to make GIF images smaller in size. It's a long story how LZW became
      part of GIF and it is not clear who violated the LZW patent in the
      first place. Anyway, recently Unisys announced that they consider
      lawsuits against those using the GIF format (i.e. software generating
      GIFs, not reading!) without a license from Unisys. LaTeX2HTML itself
      does not have a problem, because it merely uses ppmtogif and can
      easily do without if it's not there. I don't know whether it is 
      illegal or not to use ppmtogif in non-commercial environments. The
      "safe" solution is definitely to use PNG images; unfortunately
      there is AFAIK no browser available yet that displays transparent PNGs
      correctly.
