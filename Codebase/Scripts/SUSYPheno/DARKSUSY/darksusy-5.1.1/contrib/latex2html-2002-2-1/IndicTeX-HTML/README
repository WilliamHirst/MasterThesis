		--- IndicTeX/HTML ---

This is a suite of LaTeX-2e styles, with corresponding .perl
implementations for use with LaTeX2HTML, for interfacing to
existing packages and pre-processors for including traditional
Indic scripts within LaTeX documents and HTML pages.

These packages are supported by LaTeX2HTML v98.1 and later.
Translation can be performed on the manuscript either before
or after pre-processing.

( `before' is preferable, since it automates the pre-processing
 and may result in smaller HTML files+images. )


Languages covered include:

Language	support			pre-processors
_____________________________________________________________________
Bengali		bengali.sty/perl  	Indica  
Devanagri	devnagri.sty/perl 	devnag  or  patc+devnag

various		indica.sty/perl		Indica
_____________________________________________________________________

Several different transcription/transliteration schemes are supported;
see the individual .sty or .perl files for documentation.

The .perl files should be copied into the $LATEX2HTMLSTYLES directory
to become available for use with LaTeX2HTML.
Similarly, the .sty files should be copied into an appropriate place
within the texmf/ tree (or texinputs on older installations) so as to
be available for use with LaTeX. (Don't forget to rebuild the  ls-R
file for the  kpathsea  database, using  texhash  or  mktexlsr .)


Preprocessors:
_____________________________________________________________________
Indica		with Sinhala-TeX  by Yannis Haralambous
devnag		by Frans Velthuis
patc , mm	by Jeroen Hellingman
tamilize	Washington State Uni.
_____________________________________________________________________
These pre-processors and their accompanying macros are *not*
included as part of IndicTeX/HTML.
They must be obtained separately; e.g. from CTAN archives.

Support for other packages (e.g. Telugu-TeX) is planned.



I hope these will be useful.
