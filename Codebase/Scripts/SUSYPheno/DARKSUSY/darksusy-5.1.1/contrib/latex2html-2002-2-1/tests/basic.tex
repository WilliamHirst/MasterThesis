\section{Some basic stuff}

This is some simple text, containg ``a quote'' and
some \verb+verbatim text !"$ $%&/+

\subsection{Fonts}

This sections has text in several font styles: This is
\textbf{boldface} and this is \emph{emphasized}. The
same with old syntax {\bf boldface} and {\em emphasized}.

Now we'll come to some mixed ones: {\bf boldface with 
{\em emphasis} back boldface}.

And the sizes:{\large This is large} and {\small this is
small}. Now here's some {\large large {\bf boldface} and
{\em emphasis}} and {\small small {\bf boldface} and
{\em emphasis}}.

Here we include some text, but before we switch on 
{\Large Large and {\bf boldface
\input{basicinc}%
... back again} not boldface}.

This should be some bold stars: {\bf** bold} No more bold here.
