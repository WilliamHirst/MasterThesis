%% Item:
%% Test suite for l2h bug.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug description (add references to further descriptive files if possible):
%%
%% An incomplete LaTeX command (eg. \theoremstyle{..}) that is
%% passed to LaTeX through images.tex leads to an absent page in
%% the resulting DVI file.
%% See also file 'Changes'.
%%
%% Note: The broken \theoremheaderfont, \theoremstyle in images.tex
%% indicate another bug, not directly related to this one.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug caused this behaviour (may be several descriptions):
%%
%% The images following the absent page in images.tex get out of sync
%% (the amount of absent pages earlier than expected).
%% This flaw is not detected by latex2html and hence not indicated to the user!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug severity (low|bothers|problematic|urgent -- fixed|open -- message):
%% problematic -- fixed --
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug fix identification
%% (id -- l2h release (or releases for multiple fixes) -- location in file(s)):
%% jcl(pag) -- 96.1h -- latex2html
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Author: Jens Lippmann <http://www-jb.cs.uni-sb.de/~www/people/lippmann>

%% Change log (Mon/DD/YY -- author -- message):
%% jcl = Jens Lippmann

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Test suite decription:
%%
%% Some theorem stuff is used in the beginning to provide some broken
%% statements (incomplete LaTeX commands) in images.tex.
%% The document contains two equations, which must be translated into pictures
%% by l2h, no `simple math' (This is a requirement for this suite).
%% The equations are embedded in a section to assure the incomplete LaTeX
%% commands precede them in images.tex.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Expected output of this suit:
%% The html output must look like the dvi output (also watch the hints
%% given in the output itself).

Please look at next section.

\section{Section}
This section is needed to have the fake entries *before*
the math in images.tex.

The contents of math here is randomly chosen, but to assure at
least its translation into pictures.

Below an equation with Omega=... should occur:
$$\Omega=(\bar{{\cal D}^-}\cup\bar{{\cal D}^+})$$

Below an equation with V=... should occur:
$$ V={\cal E}+ZI $$
