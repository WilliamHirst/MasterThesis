%% Item:
%% Test suite for l2h image generation.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug description (add references to further descriptive files if possible):
%%
%% Image generation in l2h is known to be sensitive to handle and error-prone.
%% The test suite should cover the coarsest aspects of this task, see
%% description below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug caused this behaviour (may be several descriptions):
%%
%% The images following the absent page in images.tex get out of sync
%% (the amount of absent pages earlier than expected).
%% This flaw is not detected by latex2html and hence not indicated to the user!

%% Test suite decription:
%%
%% 0. Requirements for running this suite
%%
%% Besides the basic styles, it needs theorem.sty.
%% Use the styles of your site to get sure the suite runs with best fitting
%% version.
%%
%% 1. Introduction
%%
%% Image generation is done the following way:
%% There are TeX parts which l2h considers to be translated into an image,
%% eg. unknown environments, math, etc.
%% Therefore, at the end of its pass l2h generates the file images.tex, which
%% contains all those parts separated by a forced pagebreak.
%% Any metacommands encountered during the pass, and the used documents styles,
%% are put in front of that images.tex.
%% This file is translated to images.dvi using LaTeX in batch mode.
%% Then, dvips is called to convert every page to its own postscript file,
%% which is in turn converted to the apropriate image.
%%
%% 2. Requirements of Image Generation
%%
%% Due to the current implementation it is essentially necessary that
%% every TeX part evaluates to a dvi page of a known and fix page number.
%% This page number (also called image number) is used to process each
%% image on its own.
%% 
%% The conversion must handle several requirements:
%% a) Header of images.tex
%% - The same styles as known from the source document must be used.
%% - Any metacommand (\def,\newenvironment,etc.) which has been parsed by
%%   l2h must recur in the header
%% b) From HTML part to TeX part
%% - Contents of already digested TeX parts must be restored from HTML
%%   to TeX in a sufficient way
%% c) From TeX part to dvi file
%% - Any counter commands must recur in images.tex, located at the same
%%   context
%% - A TeX part which takes more space than one page (eg. long tables,
%%   huge images)
%%   This could result in an unwanted pagebreak which *messes up*  the
%%   image order. Such an event must be detected during image conversion.
%%   Currently, a warning will be printed if the amount of generated
%%   postscript pages exceeds the amount of expected pages.
%% - A TeX part which evaluates to no visible space (eg. broken commands)
%%   This must result in an *empty* page. See also jcl(pag).
%%   An absent page would mess up the image order.
%% - A TeX part which evaluates to visible space fitting on one page
%%   Trivial.
%% ... (to be completed)
%% d) From dvi file to postscript
%% - dvips must convert the pages into postscript files
%%   Assure correct system call.
%% ... (to be completed)
%% e) From postscript to the image
%% - The filter commands must be called to generate the apropriate
%%   image format as referenced from the HTML output
%%   Assure correct system calls.
%% ... (to be completed)
%% f) From the image to the HTML output
%% - Each image must be bound to its HTML reference
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Expected output of this suit:
%% The images of the html output must match the dvi images in a sufficing way.
%% Assure correct image order.

Please look at next section.

\section{Empty DVI Page Test}

{\bf Unwanted empty DVI page test:}

This section is needed to have some fake entries *before*
this math equation in images.tex. These fake entries result in an
empty DVI page and, with former versions of l2h, to an *absent*
DVI page (see also jcl(pag)).
However, an absent DVI page will cause the next math equation
(and the following images) to be misordered.

The contents of math here is randomly chosen, but to assure at
least its translation into pictures.

Below an equation with Omega=... should occur:
$$\Omega=(\bar{{\cal D}^-}\cup\bar{{\cal D}^+})$$

{\bf Explicit empty DVI page test:}

Below a non-visible enviroment which is passed to images.tex.

\begin{equation}
e(z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(z/L)^2}}
\end{equation}

\section{Overfull DVI Page Test}

Next page an overfull figure:

\clearpage
\postscript{pages1}{{\bf Test figure} -- Running LiPS: An Overview}
{{\bf Test text} --
This figure gives an overview on the layers constituting the LiPS-system.

The LiPS system provides the application programmer with the 
{\tt tuplespace} paradigm of distributed 
computing, where the processes of a distributed application communicate
through a virtual shared memory called {\tt tuplespace}.
The tuplespace is implemented within Serverprocesses called MessageServer.
}
\clearpage
Anything up to this point belongs to the previous figure example.


Next page an overfull self-defined environment. It should end with
'end of prefix type description'. The numbers make the entries unique
to ease comparation, the list should about 3 DVI pages long.

{\bf Known bug}: The dvips command itself shortens the page.
