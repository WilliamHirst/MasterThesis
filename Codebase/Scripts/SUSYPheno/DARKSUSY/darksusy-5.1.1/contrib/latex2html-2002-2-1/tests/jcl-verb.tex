%% Item:
%% Test suite for the verb substitution task in pre_process.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug description (add references to further descriptive files if possible):
%% In LaTeX, \begin{environment} opens a group which is ended by
%% \end{environment}, making definitions or font changes local within
%% this group. This was not seen by l2h.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug caused this behaviour (may be several descriptions):
%% Changes to the font (style, size) made within the environment are not
%% reverted after the environment closed.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug severity (low|bothers|problematic|urgent -- fixed|open -- message):
%% bothers -- fixed --
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bug fix identification
%% (id -- l2h release (or releases for multiple fixes) -- location in file(s)):
%% jcl(env) -- 96.1h -- latex2html

%% Test suite decription:
%% The suite focuses on the substitution statements of the task in pre_process().

\section*{Test Part}
%%% The Tests matching the equivalence classes.
%%% Commented-out tests don't run in LaTeX, so testing seems
%%% to be obsolete there.
%%% Note: Test cases should contain zero, one or more tabs,
%%% zero, one or more chars of verb contents and several
%%% combinations of failure and success test cases.


%%% Tests for a):

%%% false delimiter, should fail
\verbxtestax


%%% Tests for b):
%%% b11): correct \w delimiter, should pass
\verb*xtestb11x

\verb*	xtestb11x

\verb*		xtestb11x

%%% b12): correct \W delimiters, should pass
\verb*/testb12/

\verb**testb12*

\verb*\testb12\

%%% b2): no closing delimiter, should fail
%\verb*xtestb2

%%% b3): no delimiter, should fail
%testb3\verb*


%%% Tests for c):
%%% c11): correct \w delimiter, should pass
\verb_testc11_

%%% c12): correct \W delimiter, should pass
\verb/testc12/

%%% c2): no closing delimiter, should fail
%\verb_testc2


%%% Tests for d):
%%% d111): correct \w delimiter for \verb\t\t*\*, should pass
\verb	*_testd111_

\verb	*	_testd111_

\verb		*	_testd111_

%%% d112): correct \W delimiter for \verb\t\t*\*, should pass
\verb	*/testd112/

\verb	**testd112*

%%% d12): no closing delimiter for \verb\t\t*\*, should fail
%\verb	*_testd12

%%% d13): no delimiter for \verb\t\t*\*, should fail
%testd13\verb	*

%%% d211): correct \w delimiter for \verb\t\t*, should pass
\verb	xtestd211x

%%% d212): correct \W delimiter for \verb\t\t*, should pass
\verb	/testd212/

%%% d22): no closing delimiter for \verb\t\t*, should fail
%\verb	/testd22

%%% d3): no delimiter for \verb\t\t*, should fail

%%% Tests for e):

%%% Missing: combinatoric tests.
