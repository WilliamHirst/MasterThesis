%  This package is invoked by including the "heqn" style (package) in
%  your LaTeX source file.  It was no effect on the LaTeX version of
%  your document, but it alters they way equations are processed
%  by LaTeX2HTML.  This style file causes the equation numbers for
%  equations in the "equation" environment to be processed by
%  LaTeX2HTML as text in front of the equation.  The advantage of
%  doing this is that the equations become order-independent and
%  do not have to be regenerated every time the document is modified
%  in the slightest way.
