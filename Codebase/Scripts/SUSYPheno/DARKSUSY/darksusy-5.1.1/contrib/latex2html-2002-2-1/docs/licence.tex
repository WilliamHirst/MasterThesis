\subparagraph*{Year 2000 compliance:\label{y2k}}%
%
\latextohtml{} contains *no* executable software, \emph{per se}.
It consists entirely of scripts to run other pieces of software:
\Perl, \LaTeX, \appl{Ghostscript}, \fn{netpbm}, etc.
and standard Unix utilities 
(e.g. \texttt{cp}, \texttt{rm}, \texttt{make}, \texttt{ln}, ... )
as well as the operating system shell.

These other pieces of software are to be obtained and installed
independent from the \latextohtml{} scripts.

\latextohtml{} makes no reference to dates,
apart from reading the current date from the operating system,
and converting the resulting string data into a standard form.
This may result in `00' appearing in the year 2000.
However this representation of the date is used \emph{for display only};
it does \emph{not} control any further processing.
