Introduction
============
This is mostly the c++ version of galprop, although the code contains 
several fortran subroutines inherited from the original version.

Featuring:
* Galactic cosmic-ray propagation in 2D and 3D
* nuclear network & cross-sections database
* electrons, positrons, antiprotons, gamma-rays
* stochastic SNR source option
* vector processing option for 3D
* Dark Matter package
* self-consistent particle-MHD wave interaction formalism
* new interstellar radiation field (by T.Porter & A.Strong, astro-ph/0507119)
* new HI and CO gas maps by Seth Digel (please, acknowledge in your papers 
  if you use it)

Documentation of the methods and the code is in: galprop.ps

On-line documentation is at:

Acknowledgements
================
The GALPROP code is so far an effort of two individuals (Igor V. Moskalenko & 
Andrew W. Strong). Other people have contributed by providing the data sets
(Seth W. Digel, Stepan G. Mashnik, Troy A. Porter, Olaf Reimer) or their own 
nuclear cross section codes (W.R.Webber, R.Silberberg, C.H.Tsao, V.S.Barashenkov, 
A.Polanski).

The GALPROP Web-site at http://galprop.stanford.edu is supported by 
NASA through APRA "Laboratory Astrophysics" grant, by Stanford University,
and by GALPROP project. This is a free service to the Astrophysical community. 
GALPROP source code can be freely copied, however, it is requested that 
in any subsequent use of this work be given appropriate acknowledgment. 

Building galprop
================

The galprop program requires the FITSIO package obtainable from
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/

In the following it is assumed FITSIO is a directory (or link) where FITSIO is installed.

To build the program, edit the Makefile (provided) to make sure the paths to the libraries
and inclide files are correct, then type "make".  

Directory structure
===================
In the delivered configuration the following directories are set:
../GALDEF         contains the "galdef" files containing run parameters
../FITS           contains the input and output FITS data

This configuration can be changed by editing Configure.cc and recompiling it and
 relinking galprop.

Input datasets
==============
The following input datasets are included in the distribution in ../FITS
Interstellar radiation field: isrf_interp_04_000015, 
MilkyWay_DR0.5_DZ0.1_DPHI10_RMAX20_ZMAX5_galprop_format.fits
HI skymaps: (for gamma-ray skymaps) COMPASS.COR.*
CO skymaps: (for gamma-ray skymaps) COMPASS.HIR.*

To run galprop
==============

cd to the directory where it has been built and do eg
./galprop 599278

This runs galprop with parameter file    ../GALDEF/galdef_50p_599278
The output FITS files are in files like    ../FITS/nuclei_50p_599278

Sample galdef file (e.g. 599278 for 2D) is included in the 
distribution, and it is suggested to test first with this.

This code has been successfully run under Linux, Unix, Mac.
The authors are interested in information on portability to other platforms.

Included in this distribution are a number of idl programs (*.pro) which
are intended to illustrate how the results can be read and plotted, but
they are exemplary only and not maintained or documented.

The C++ plotting program is a part of the distribution.
The program must be installed in ../CPLOTS directory and uses
FITSIO library and GNUPLOT to produce postscript output file (tmp.ps).


Notes about the dark matter (DM) package (imos 9/14/2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The list of modified files (changes are labelled: IMOS20050912):

create_galaxy.cc
create_gcr.cc
Galaxy.h
Galdef.cc
Galdef.h
Galprop.cc
Galprop.h
gen_DM_skymap.cc
gen_DM_source.cc
gen_secondary_source.cc
gen_synch_emiss.cc
nuclei_normalize.cc
store_DM_emiss.cc
store_DM_skymap.cc

Restrictions:
The 3D version is not fully consistent. The calculation of the
gamma-ray emission and skymap from the DM annihilation is calculated
assuming 2D cylindrical symmetry.
The integration over the line of sight is restricted by R=r_max,
and z_min<=Z<=z_max (see galdef-file for the definitions).
