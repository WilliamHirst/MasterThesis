The general procedure to get isajet (or really isasugra) for DarkSUSY is:

* Download isajet from
  http://www.hep.fsu.edu/~isajet/

* Then extract isajet with the command
  make isajet.f
  Alternatively, run nypatchy on isajet.car using the commands discovered by running make -n isajet.f.

* Make a directory 'small-files' and put isajet.f in there, then split it into
  smaller files with:
  fcsasplit isajet.f
 
  (or use f77split from http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~burkardt/c_src/f77split/f77split.html if fcsasplit is not available).

* Create a new directory with files for DarkSUSY, e.g. isajet778-for-darksusy:

* Copy the files in the small-files directory that are needed into that new
  directory. The needed files are aldata.f and all the corresponding .f-files
  that are defined in OBJ in the makefile. There is a script called
  copy-needed-files.sh that can be used (after updating it) to do this.

* NOTICE: for compatibility with gfortran, change 'BLOCK DATA' to 'SUBROUTINE' in aldata.f.

* Check that the interface in src/rge is OK with the new version (.e.g. that
  the common blocks are defined correctly in include/dsisasugra.h).

* Try to compile dstest-isasugra.f with this new version. If it works,
  everything is fine. However, there may be some more of the small files that
  are needed. Then add them and try again.
