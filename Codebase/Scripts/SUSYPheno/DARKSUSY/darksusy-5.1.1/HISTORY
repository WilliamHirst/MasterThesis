Version history for DarkSUSY
============================

====================================================== VERSION HISTORY

* Updated configure scripts to be more automatic in choosing a compiler
  and compiler options.

* Updated wimpexample and other main programs to call dsntrates in
  a correct way.

* Deleted binary files for HiggsBounds that are created at run-time

------- trunk @ rev 792

* iclike branch rev. 791 merged into the trunk:

  * Added IceCube likelihood calculations

  * Various bug fixes and corrections

------- trunk @ rev xxx

* Updated to WimpSim runs from January 2013. WimpSim is run with version 3.04
  and with nusigma 1.17 and with more mass points at low masses. The
  interpolation between different mass points is changed to linear for 
  safer interpolation.

------- trunk @ rev xxx

* Updated to WimpSim runs from May 2012 (with WimpSim 3.01 and new
  neutrino oscillation global fits)

------- trunk @ rev xxx

* Changed the way contributed packages are handled. We no longer use symbolic
  links to decide which version to use. Instead the correct version is
  set in configure.ac (that is transferred to the configure script with
  autoconf). See README.DEVELOPER for more info.

------- trunk @ rev 497

* Upgraded to isajet 7.79

* Runs with gfortran on intel mac

* Fixed some problems with galprop c++ libraries

* Fixed some issues with FeynHiggs and gfortran

------- trunk @ rev xxx

* Added routines to calculate the kinetic decoupling and the
  corresponding smallest halo masses

------- Version: 5.0.5 (June 11, 2009) --- Created from trunk @ rev 467

* Fixed lines longer than 72 lines and added script to correct these
  semi-automatically.

* Added possiblitiy to calculate neutrino telescope rates from the Sun
  and direct detection rates for a dark disk (not included by default).

* Updated FeynHiggs to 2.6.5 and added a small modification to avoid
  cache memory problmes on some machines (this modified version is
  called 2.6.5.1 in DarkSUSY).

* Made DarkSUSY compilable with gfortran (g77 and ifort works since before).
  The configure script picks g77 as a default. Use conf.xxx where xxx is
  your compiler of choice to configure with your preferred compiler.

* Added option (new default) to calculate Higgs widths and decay branching
  fractions with FeynHiggs.

* Added option (new default) to check Higgs bounds with HiggsBounds.

* Improved positron routines to work more reliably with cuspy profiles
  and very hard source spectra.

* Various minor improvements (check svn log for details).


------- Version: 5.0.4 (December 5, 2008) --- Created from trunk @ rev 317

* Made the halo annihilation routines and the neutrino telescope routines
  more modular (unsusyfied) so that it is now easier to use them for
  non-SUSY models. Added example program wimpexample.f in misc/ that shows
  how to use these routines for general WIMPs.

* Fixed bug in dsinit that caused sin^2 theta_W at the Z-mass to be evaluated
  with the wrong top mass (175 GeV instead of the mtpole value set
  in dsinit).

------- Version: 5.0.3 (November 18, 2008) --- Created from trunk @ rev 311

* Added option to write out SLHA files in the dsmain program (in test).

* Added more flexibility to the SLHA routines. DarkSUSY can now read
  more kinds of files and also write both MFV files with only third
  generation mixing as well as full 6x6 mixing SLHA files.

* Added an option to make a more conservative estimate of WIMP capture
  in the Sun. Instead of assuming that WIMPs are captured if they are 
  scattered to velocities less than the escape velocity at that point,
  this new option will only consider WIMPs as captured if they are
  scattered to orbits that do not reach further out than Jupiter. The
  rationale for this is work by Peter and Tremaine showing that WIMPs
  that reach out to Jupiter have a high probability of being gravitationally
  scattered out of the solar system before they scatter again and sink
  to the core of the Sun. This new option underestimates the capture rate
  as some of these WIMPs will be captured and hence, the default is to 
  use the old expressions without this new cutoff. To use the new expressions,
  issue a call to dsntset('tabcut'). The Jupiter cut-off affects heavy WIMPs
  only (15% reduction at 1 TeV for spin-dependent scatter, 85% reduction at
  10 TeV for spin-dependent scatter, much less reduction for spin-independent
  scatter).

---------- Version: 5.0.2 (September 10, 2008)

* Fixed a bug in dsrdaddpt that caused a floating point exception on some
  compilers.

* Made changes to where we use the on-shell value of sin^2 theta_W and where
  we use the MS-bar value at MZ (e.g. some of the accelerator constraint
  routines).

---------- Version: 5.0.1 (July 9, 2008)

* Made changes to the configure script and the SLHA interface to
  compile properly on g77.

* Made changes to the SLHA interface to
  - be more compatible with the accord
  - make sure that when we read SLHA files, we still keep the tree level
    relation between MZ, MW and sin^2 theta_W for unitarity reasons.
    If MW is given, we calcualte sin^2 theta_W from it (and MZ),
    otherwise we calculate both MW and sin^2 theta_W from the
    SM inputs.

* Changed value of sin^2 theta_W that is used for M1:M2:M3 gut relations.
  Now we use sin^2 theta_W at MZ in the MS-bar scheme for the GUT relations
  (as opposed to the on-shell value that were used after the introduction
  of that earlier for other calculations). The on-shell value is still
  used in e.g. annihilation cross section calculation.

---------- Version: 5.0 (July 3, 2008)

* Changed the convention for the quark masses in the mass array.
  For u, d and s, we now put the quark masses at 2 GeV in the
  MS-bar scheme in the array and for c, b and t, we put the
  pole masses.

* Changed the default top mass from 175 GeV to 172.7 GeV.

* Changed SM input from sin^2 theta_W to GF (the Fermi constant from
  muon decay). As a consequence of this, we now calculate sin^2 theta_W
  from GF with on-shell formulas in PDG. From this value of
  sin^2 theta_W we then enforce the tree-level relations between MZ,
  sin^2 theta_W and MW to determinte the MW mass. In practice, this
  procedure gives a lower value of sin^2 theta_W and a higher value
  of MW than before which affects some cross sections.

* Added routines to do 4-loop running of quark masses. In the future,
  we will use these routines more extensively to put the masses at
  more suitable scales for each given process.

* Added an interface to read and write SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA)
  files. There are many options that can be considered in the SLHA
  convention and not all are covered with the current version of the
  interface, so this will be an evolving part of DarkSUSY.

* FeynHiggs updated to version 2.6.3

* Isajet updated to version 7.78.

* Changed effective degrees of freedom in the early Universe to 
  Hindmarsch & Philipsen set B (increases the relic density by
  1.5% - 3.5%).

* Full 6x6 sfermion diagnonalization now possible. Note though that not
  all other routines can make full use of this extra freedom yet.

* New neutrino telescope rate routines with full three flavour information
  and neutrino oscillations.

* A bug in halo annihilation routines that incorrectly took away 
  the yield from some decay channels from Higgs bosons decaying in flight
  has been corrected. This bug affected the cascade decay of neutral
  Higgs bosons that decayed to gauge bosons and the decay of the
  charged Higgs boson.

* Changed default halo profile to NFW instead of a cored isothermal
  sphere.

* Added new standard model calculation of b -> s gamma (dsbsg2007full.f)
  and updated the accelerator bounds for b->s gamma (dsacbnd7 is now the
  new default).

* Added internal bremsstrahlung (IB) photons (FSR and VIB photons). These
  appear att high energies when e.g. there are degeneracies between
  the lightest neutralino and sfermions, or for H+- and W+- final states.

* First galprop interface added

* Now uses a configure script to set up the makefiles before compilation.
  It is now possible to install DarkSUSY in your favourite location (e.g.
  /usr/local). The default is to install in the DarkSUSY directory itself.

* Small fixes to the sfermion coannihilation routines (now with complete
  CKM mixings). This affectes mainly high-mass neutralinos.

---------- Version 4.1.6:  April, 2006 ----------

* Cleaned up the earth density and composition routines.

* Added routines that calculate the electron density in the Earth as
  a function of the radius (needed for neutrino oscillation code).
  Column densities in the Sun are now also present.

---------- Version 4.1.5:  April, 2006 ----------

* Merged together different subversions. Added a cleaner way of adding
  coannihilating particles (everything is done in dsrdomega now).

* Small bug fixes in the relic density routines (rare infinite loops
  caught)

* A bug in the full numerical solar capture rates fixed (the rates were
  over-estimated by 6%).

* New standard solar model used: BS05(OP). Gives very good ageement
  with the old BP2000 model, but with about 1% higher capture rates.
  The new alternative solar model, BS05(AGS,OP) with new heavy element
  abundances is also available. This model give a 4% higher capture
  rate on Hydrongen, but lower (about 20%) on the heavier elements.
  However, it doesn't fit helioseismology as well, so we use the BS05(OP)
  as the default.

---------- Version 4.1.4:  December, 2005 ----------

* Started adding routines to get column densities etc in the Sun. These
  are then used by an external neutrino oscillation code.

---------- Version 4.1.2:  September, 2005 ----------

* Fixed a problem with sfermion coannihilations at very high masses.

* Changed artificial width of sparticles to work better with very high
  mass models.

---------- Version 4.1.1: November 17, 2004 ----------

* Fixed a bug which could cause the relic density routines to crash
  if the print level was set to print all information/error messages

---------- Version 4.1: June 8, 2004 ----------

* Small bugfixes, most of which were not imporant (the only exception
  being the scattering rates on Na-23 and the spin-dependent
  scattering rates on specific nuclei. Note that the scattering cross
  sections on protons and neutrons were not affected).

* The MSSM test models used by test/dstest.f have been updated to
  correspond to the benchmark models in the DarkSUSY paper,
  astro-ph/0406204.

---------- Version 4.00: February 19, 2004 ----------

* New public release

---------- Version 4.00-pre7: February 19, 2004 ----------

* Added direct detection on various nuclei

* Cleaned up the code

* Updated the test files in test/

---------- Version 4.00-pre3: February 17, 2004 ----------

* Added new J(Psi) routines in src/hm.

* Code partly cleaned up.

---------- Version 4.00-pre2: February 16, 2004 ----------

* Cleaned up the code a little bit.

* Added the latest dbar routines and new updated halo properties from Piero.

---------- Version 4.00-pre1: February 16, 2004 ----------

* Merged with Paolo's routines:
  - Galactic center routines (though without the correct thick
    source treatment) included.
  - Direct detection routines updated. Drees-Nojiri formulae can be
    used and rates on various elements can be calculated.
  - Bug fixes in muon g-2 routines
  - Rearrangment of routines for annihilation rates are rest in the halo
  - Bug fixe for the neutrino yukawas.
  - Better error handling for mass diagonlization.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta24: February 13, 2004 ----------

* Piero's new positron routines are included. They are tested against
  Ted's routines and for non-cuspy profiles they agree. For cuspy profiles,
  Piero's routines give larger fluxes due to the fact that these routines
  integrate the source over both r and z and does not approximate the source
  as uniform in z as is done in Ted's routines. We have verified that Piero's
  routines with the same approximation gives the same result as Ted's
  routines. The new routines are in src/ep_clump/ and share many of 
  the common block of Ted's routines.

* The diffusion parameters for positron model esu04 have been corrected.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta23: February 10, 2004 ----------

* New velocity distribution routines for Burkert and N03 (adiabsm)
  profiles

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta21: January 26, 2004 ----------

* The pbar routines are updated to also include the routines to create
  data files for the new propagation routines

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta20: January 21, 2004 ----------

* ep routines updated to use Piero's diffusion parameters through the
  option 'esu04'.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta19: January 21, 2004 ----------

* New halo routines implemented. The possibility to use the Burkert
 profile has been added. The diffusion parameters for pbar, dbar and eplus
 have also been updated.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta18: December 23, 2003 ----------

* A bug in the form factors for the Earth and the Sun numerical capture
  rates was fixed. For the Earth, this had little effect, but for the
  Sun, the fix is important.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta17: December 16, 2003 ----------

* Results of a new solar system diffusion with solar depletion are
  now implemented.

* A bug in the Sun and Earth capture rates was fixed. The affected
  Earth routine was by default not used, so the Earth capture
  rates were OK. The Sun capture rates were on the other hand over-
  estimated by about 25-30%.

* Isasugra version 7.69 can now be used for the mSUGRA RGE running.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta15: May 23, 2003 ----------

* The isasugra interface is trimmed to correctly identify unphysical
  models as such.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta14: May 21, 2003 ----------

* Isasugra version 7.67 is now implemented to use with DarkSUSY. Compared
  to the earlier version 7.64, full one-loop corrections are now
  included for the sparticle masses, which change these by up to 5%.
  The isasugra routines have been converted to double precision to
  make them more stable in e.g. the focus point region and the convergence
  criteria are tightened compared to the isasugra distribution.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta13: May 15, 2003 ----------

* The b -> s gamma routines have been updated to include higher order
  loop corrections in the SM and SUSY calculation. The accelerator bound
  routine has been updated to compare with the current world-average
  of BR(b-> s gamma).
* Anti-deutron fluxes have been added. 

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta12: January 22, 2003 ----------

* A missing factor of 1/2 (see Ullio et al, PRD66(2002)123502) in
  the annihilation rates for annihilation in the halo has been inserted.
  Routines returning expressions like N*(sigma v) are not affected;
  only the routines returning a resulting flux have been modified.
  In addition, the neutrino fluxes from the Sun and the Earth have
  not been modifed as these included the factor of 1/2 already.
* The antiproton routines have been modifed so that different
  pbtd.dat files are used for different propagation models.
 

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta11: December 11, 2002 ----------

* A few errors on the ISAUGRA interface have been fixed
* ISASUGRA version 7.64 is now used. We have converted this
  into double-precision and increased the convergence criteria
  from the default values to make it stable in e.g. the
  focus point region.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta10: October 10, 2002 ----------

* For extreme parameters, cancellation errors could occur for some
  sfermion coannihilation channels. This is now taken care of.
* On some systems (Sun), the anstau-efos routines wouldn't compile
  due to missed external declarations. This is now fixed (even though
  these routines are never used).
* A missing process sfmerion coannihilation process has been inserted
  (slepton + slepton* -> nu nu-bar with chi+ exchange)
* The routine dreal in contrib/feynhiggs commented out since it
  conflicts with the intrinsic dreal on some systems.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta9: October 3, 2002 ----------

* Changed the maximal momentum p that is used in the relic density
  routines. It is usually set to p_max ~ 26 m_x to cover a large
  integration region even for small x. Changed the maximum to
  15*m_x instead and itroduced an extrapolation in dsrdwintp. This
  avoids sampling the cross sections in regions which in rare cases
  are numerically unstable (large cancellation errors).
  It should not affect the results of the relic density calculation.
* Fixed a few bugs in the new higwid routine
* Changed name of two FeynHiggs routines that conflicted with common
  blocks in private DarkSUSY routines.
* Updated accelerator constraints to pdg2002 (approximately).
  The new routines are in dsacbnd4.f and are used as a default
  when dsacbnd.f is called. The old routines will be used if
  a call to dsacset('pdg2000') is made before the call to dsacbnd.f.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta8: September 18, 2002 ----------

* QCD corrections to Higgs widths and vertices added. Bugs in
  Higgs widths routines fixed.
* Running couplings and masses implemented in a simple way.
* Interface to HDECAY available (call dshdecay to set widths
  from there instead. Currently masses are set as well, uncomment
  in src/xhdecay/dshdecay.f if not wanted).
* Bugs in some vertices with A-terms fixed (sign error).

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta7: July 12, 2002 ----------

* Sfermion coannihilations included.
* Bug in chargino-(up-squark)-(down-quark) vertex fixed (sign error)
* Interface to Isajet v7.63
* Interface to full FeynHiggs routines (v.1.2.2)
* Many small fixes and improvements here and there

---------- Version 3.14.03-beta: April, 2001 ----------

* On systems with long directory names there was a problem with reading
  the datafiles. The limit on the length of the directory names has
  now been increased.

---------- Version 3.14.02-beta: February 19, 2001 ----------

* A bug in the Z gamma expressions fixed.
* The rate in neutrino telescopes was not correct when the
  Damour-Krauss population of neutralinos was included (non-standard
  option) and the effect of the new population was significant. This
  is now fixed.
* The idtag flag is no longer set in dsgive_model.
* The MSSM contribution to the g-2 amplitude can now be calculated.
* A flag in pbset was not saved properly. This caused a problem
  with some compilers. This is now fixed.
* The accelerator bound on mh2 was incorrect. This is now fixed.
* The call to dswhwarn in dstest.f was incorrect. This is now fixed.
* Makefiles rewritten to work better on different platforms.

---------- Version 3.14.01-beta: September 15, 2000 ----------

* First public release.
