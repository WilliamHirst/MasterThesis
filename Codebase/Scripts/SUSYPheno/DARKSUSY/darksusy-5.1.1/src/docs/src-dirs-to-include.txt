# This file includes the directories in src/, which should be searched
# by the script headers2tex.pl. The script will look in these directories
# for documentation tex-files and for headers in the Fortran routines.
#
# The format below is that each directory resides on one row with the first
# element being the directory name and the rest being the title
# of that chapter as it will appear in the manual. The order in which 
# the directories appear below is the order in which the chapters will
# appear in the manual.
