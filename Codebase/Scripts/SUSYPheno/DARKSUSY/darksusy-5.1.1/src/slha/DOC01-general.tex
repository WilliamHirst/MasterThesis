\section{SUSY Les Houches Accord}

\ds\ includes routines to read and write SUSY Les Houches Accord 
\cite{slha,slha2} files (SLHA
files). This is done with the help of \code{SLHALIB} by T.~Hahn \cite{slhalib}.

\ds\ will write SLHA2 files and expect to get SLHA2 as well. The implementation
right now takes a middle path between dumping everything or just
a minimal set of inputs to the SLHA2 file. This choice was made to make most
other SLHA2-aware programs able to exchange SLHA2 files with \ds.

However, we have not made a careful testing with lots of other codes, so
if you try this out, please let us know if there are some things that don't
work or could work better.
