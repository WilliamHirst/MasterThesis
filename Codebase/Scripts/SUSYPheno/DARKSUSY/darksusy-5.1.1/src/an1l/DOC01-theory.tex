\section{Annihilation cross sections at 1-loop -- general }

The annihilation cross sections at 1-loop that we have implemented in
\ds\ are those to $\gamma \gamma$, $Z \gamma$ and $g g$. The
derivation of these is described in the works \cite{ggullio,zgullio}.

To see how these routines are called, see the file
\codeb{src/an/dsandwdcosnn.f} where the $\gamma \gamma$, $Z \gamma$
and $g g$ contributions are added to the annihilation cross section at
the end.
