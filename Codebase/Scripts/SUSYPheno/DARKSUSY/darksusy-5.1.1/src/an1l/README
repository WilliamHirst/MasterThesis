The an1l directory contains subroutines and functions to compute
the amplitudes of a few processes of neutralino pair annihilation
into 2-body final states allowed at 1-loop level. 
All processes are computed in the limit of vanishing relative 
velocity of the neutralino pair (S-wave only).

The processes are:

1) annihilation into 2 photons: real and imaginary parts of the 
amplitude are given, respectively, in anggre.f and anggim.f 
(which in turn call anggrepar.f and anggimpar.f).

2) annihilation into 2 gluons: real and imaginary parts of the 
amplitude are given, respectively, in anglglre.f and anglglim.f.

3) annihilation into 1 photon and 1 Z boson: real and imaginary parts 
of the amplitude are given in anzg.f (which in turn calls anzgpar.f).

The remaining .f files contain auxiliary functions and subroutines
which are used as specified in the header of each file.
