\section{$b \rightarrow s \gamma$ -- routines}

The main routines is \codeb{dsbsgammafull} which calls the latest
routine \codeb{dsbsg2007full}. For historical reasons, the old (pre-2007)
calculations are available in \codeb{dsbsgpre2007full}.

The main routine \codeb{dsbsgammafull} returns the $b
\rightarrow s \gamma$ branching ratio. The routine can calculate
either only the standard model contribution or also include the SUSY
contribution (which is of course the default when this routine is
called from \codeb{dsacbnd}). The reaming (large) set or routines are
the various contributions to the decay as given in the references
listed above.
