\section{Annihilation cross sections with sfermions -- general }

In this directory, all the (co)annihilation cross sections involving
one or more sfermions in the initial state are calculated. The code
here is based upon the work described in \cite{sfcoann}. All the cross
sections are calculated with \code{Form} and converted to Fortran with
a script \codeb{form2f} \cite{form2f}. 

The main routines here are

\begin{brief-subs}
\bsub{dsasdwdcossfsf}
  Calculates the invariant annihilation rate between two sfermions in
  the initial state.
\bsub{dsasdwdcossfchi}
  Calculates the invariant annihilation rate between one sfermion and
  one fermion (neutralino or chargino) in the iniital state.
\end{brief-subs}
