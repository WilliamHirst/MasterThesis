\section{Anti-deuteron fluxes from annihilation in the halo}

The anti-deuteron fluxes are calculated here following the approach of
\cite{dbar}. This means that we calculate the anti-deuteron fluxes
based on a merging model of antiprotons and antineutrons in quark
jets. Apart from this, the anti-deuterons are propagated in the same
way as antiprotons.
